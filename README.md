# StudyConnect Frontend

This project is part of the **StudyConnect** platform, which aims to help students connect, collaborate, and organize study sessions. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.   It uses **TypeScript** for type-safe development and **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first styling approach.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
